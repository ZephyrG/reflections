The first version works normally but after changes were made, it did not work out. Therefore bug happens where the changes were.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

find the changes decrition from git log and compare.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

because i can always go back and find out what goes wrong.
